# National_Highway_Traffic-Safety_Administration_Analysis

This project is an analysis of data availble from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

As a public health researcher, I am very interested in spreading awareness towards health issues that I beleive are not fully understood by the general public. I beleive that the true risk of riding motorcycles and mopeds are not fully understood by the people who ride them. The goal of this analysis is to fully understand and quantify, using real historical traffic data from the NHTSA, just how dangerous these vehicles can be.

This is publicly available data on all motor vehicle crashes in the US from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

FARS is a census of fatal motor vehicle crashes with a set of data files documenting all qualifying fatalities that occurred within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico since 1975. To qualify as a FARS case, the crash had to involve a motor vehicle traveling on a traffic way customarily open to the public, and must have resulted in the death of a motorist or a non-motorist within 30 days of the crash.
